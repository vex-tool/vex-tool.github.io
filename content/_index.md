The Vulnerability EXploration Tool (VEXT) is provided to promote the research within the vulnerability ecosystem.
While working at UCSB, I have had the chance to work on significant projects with remarkable individuals.

## Projects
 - Built a cloud-based cyber range for the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/) [Action Institute](https://action.ucsb.edu/).
 - Core contributor on the [DARPA HARDEN](https://www.darpa.mil/program/hardening-development-toolchains-against-emergent-execution-engines) project.
 - Spearheaded the strategic migration of a data center while contributing to the ongoing research of [Chris Kruegel](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~chris/), [Giovanni Vigna](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/) and many others.
 - Collaborated with [Kelly Caylor](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/kelly-caylor) at [waves lab](http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/) on socio-physical modeling projects.
 - Consulted on a variety of projects at [ERI](https://eri.ucsb.edu) (such as implementing seismic algorithms in Python with [Jamison Steidl](https://www.eri.ucsb.edu/people/jamison-steidl) for [NEES](http://www.nees.ucsb.edu/) and modeling waves in the open ocean with [Tim DeVries](https://tdevries.eri.ucsb.edu/) and [Leonel Romero](https://leonelromero.com/)).
 - Led the management of the campus enterprise resource planning tool, ensuring its maintenance, modernization, and migration during a major transition to a new financial backend.
 - Developed tooling to facilitate the migration to a centralized campus identity system.
 - Automated the migration of student email to the cloud.
 - Contributed to the infrastructure of the new campus data center - built an emergency shutdown system based on environmental sensors.

## Teaching and Mentoring
I am passionate about learning, teaching, and mentoring.
My experience ranges from teaching [introductory programming courses](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/) at the [DREAMLAB](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/dreamlab), to mentoring undergraduate teams through research in the UCSB ERSP program ([22-23](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/2022-2023-projects-0), [23-24](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/2023-2024-projects-0)).
I developed the materials for an upper-division course on [Programming Languages](https://cs-105.github.io/) that I have taught at Westmont College.
The small class size enabled me to create and foster an engaged learning environment in the classroom.
This past summer I helped to lead the inaugural summer mentor program for the Action Institute that brought students from around the country, and led a team of undergraduates to develop cyber-security skills within a cloud-based cyber-range.
